# motor-minded
This project was initially created as a school project. However, I decided to invest some time and turn the demo into a working website. The website is currently only available locally, but I plan to deploy it to a live server in the future.

The website is a simple motoring enthusiasts' forum. Users can create accounts and post photos.

The website is built using the following technologies:
PHP
JavaScript
MySQL
